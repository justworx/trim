# The `Screen` Class

This is an attempt to create an easy-to-use screen-controling object.
I don't really know much about curses, so it'll probably be a while
before it becomes useful. However, it's fascinating and fun, so I'm
going to spend some time on it now.


#### Where are we?

Here's where we are - I can get a screen open, but can't yet do
anything else.

Use Ctrl-c to exit the following screen.

```
from trix.x.xcurses import *
c = Screen()

```

#### Next...

I'm experimenting with drawing on the screen.
