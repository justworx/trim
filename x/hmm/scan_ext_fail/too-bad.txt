It's too bad about this. It seems like a good idea to turn a lot of 
those non-essential Scanner methods into "extentions" that are loaded
only as needed. I'm thinking there could be dozens or hundreds more
added to that extentions folder... if only I could make it work.

My brain needs some rest. Maybe I'll come back to it again someday.
