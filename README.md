# trix

This is the fifth rough draft. It's incomplete and under construction.
I'll be adding content as time permits, but with important changes.


#### under construction!

Everything in this trix package should be considered to be "Under 
Construction", subject to change, and potentially buggy.


#### about rd5

Many of the goals for rd4 have been implemented, but an overhaul is
needed for many of the classes to take advantage of some features that
improve consistency in obtaining and using method results. This will
become apparent as more packages are re-added to the project. 

Also, the testing procedure created for rd4 needs an overhaul; rd4 
made a good start, but it badly needs reorganization for easier 
updates during development.

The plan is to very carefully (and, unfortunately, probably slowly)
rebuild the entire package giving careful attention to these two
goals (method result consistency and automated testing proceedures).


#### doc

Documentation for this rough draft 5 will be a while in coming. Much
of what's available in trix_rd4 will apply, but some of the doc will
need to be rewritten, or at least updated.


#### thanks

Thanks to everyone who's helped me out on this project:

 * jotun, for the binary search function for ucd lists.
 * mknod, for the unicode info and advice. WORD!
