# UTIL - Import Consistency
#

Some modules in the util package import other trix modules from 
outside util. For now, it's only ok for util modules to import 
from `trix` and `trix.fmt`. I've moved the following from util 
to `trix.app`: [event, process, jconfig]

There may be more such modules in the util package. When I encounter 
them, I'll add them to the list above.
